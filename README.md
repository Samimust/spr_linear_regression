### Data:

The Boston Housing data set contains information about the housing values in suburbs of Boston.

### Approach:

Plot the target(price) against individual feautures to identify the relationship between them. Then use statsmodels and Sklearn Linear Regression model to predict house price from house features. Use graphs like Resedual Plots to check if the model is appropriate for the data.
